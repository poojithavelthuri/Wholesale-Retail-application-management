The AK Boss Retailers Management System is a custom-built application designed to automate and streamline the core operations of AK Boss Retailers. It replaces manual tools like Excel and basic invoicing software by centralizing order processing, customer information, and product management into a single, secure system.

With role-based access, Admins can manage products, customers, orders, users, and generate business reports, while Staff can view products and customer data, create orders, and generate invoices. The system features automated order tracking and invoicing to reduce manual errors and speed up workflows. Reporting tools provide valuable insights into sales and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making and supporting future business growth.
